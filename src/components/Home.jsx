          <h2>Film Synopsis</h2>
          <p>
            ‘Us Kids: An Alternative Music Rebellion' provides an engaging
            journey through the past of alternative music from Califonia.
            Beginning in Orange County and gradually branching out across the
            country (and around the world) this film tells the story of
            musicians who were at the center of an alternative rock movement
            rooted in faith during the '80s and 90s.
          </p>

          <p>
            The musicians and artists of the 'Us Kids' story were raised in a
            landscape filled with struggles and challenges around every corner.
            It was these experiences that collectively helped shape the Southern
            (and Northern) California music scene as we know it today.
          </p>

          <p>
            You'll hear story after story filled with personal triumphs,
            heartache and humor as they recall in vivid detail the recording
            sessions, concert tours and behind-the-scenes adventures that only
            rock and roll can provide. This unique documentary film pays tribute
            to the rebellious spirit of the music that dared to challenge the
            norms of both the church and mainstream culture.

            'Us Kids' is a "must see" for music fans everywhere, and for anyone
            who appreciates the ability of music to bind people together for a
            lifetime.
